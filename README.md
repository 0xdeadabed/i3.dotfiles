# My Arch Linux configurations

## Attention:
I'm using intel, therefore some packages may not work for you, for example xbacklight works only with Intel.

## Requirements:

Here is some packages needed in order to the config work fine, they all can be found in the pacman package manager or AUR.

My drivers specifics:

Pacman:
* xorg -> obvious
* xorg-xinput -> manage keyboard inputs easily
* xorg-xbacklight -> screen light management
* alsa-utils -> sound utilities
* i3-gaps -> I like gaps
* i3status
* Kitty terminal
* feh -> To set wallpaper
* ttf-font-awesome -> My lovely awesome fonts
* thunar -> File manager
* rofi -> Application launcher

AUR:
* nerd-fonts-hack
